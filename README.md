# Regression_Analysis_PSA
An inferential model for prostate specific antigen (PSA).


PSA is commonly used as a screening mechanism for detecting prostate cancer. However, to be an efficient screening tool it is important that we understand how PSA levels relate to factors that may determine prognosis and outcome. The primary goal of this analysis is to develop a model for PSA to be used for inferential purpose. For input dataset, we want to infer how the output is generated as a function of the data. The different steps employed for building the model are checking basic assumptions, selecting transformations as needed, handling outliers and model verification. The following files are available as part of this project:
